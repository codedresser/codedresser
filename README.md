**About @codedresser**

"What can I learn next ?" This question motivates me and is the reason I have worked with so many different people on so many different projects. It's the reason I'm not scared of change and starting again in a new industry. It's the reason I'm still young at heart. It's the reason why I'm excited to work in Tech.

I have always loved making things, being creative and working with different people. I studied Graphic Design and Illustration in Buckinghamshire then worked in London design agencies for a few years followed by ten years teaching art and design at a boarding school in the Essex countryside. I went back to the city of London to learn to cut hair and then moved to Birmingham with my wife. Each move, each change spurred on by the question "What can I learn next ?". 

Now, I am learning to code and have realised the world of tech is filled with people who like to learn. Tech is always changing and developing. "What can I learn next?" will become a necessity. And I look forward to it. 

So ask me today "What will I learn next?" and the answer you will get is "Next.js".
