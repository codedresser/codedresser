**About @codedresser**

I am currently preparing to launch in to tech at *The School of Code* with Bootcamp 12 on Monday 25th April 2022.

... and I promised myself this is going to be my last career change! 

At a young 42 years of age I have had a few previous careers which may appear random at first, but they have an artistic commonality:

- Junior Chef
- Graphic Designer
- Illustrator
- Art and Design Teacher
- Photography Teacher
- Barber

*Why learn to code?*

I'm pretty good with computers, embracing problems and finding solutions. I've got a creative head on my shoulders and think (but I do not know) that I'll be good at coding. I have a good sense of what looks good so I'm hoping this will help me too!

More importantly I'm looking to improve my lifestyle... work from home, spend time with my wife and dog, earn a good wage and not be standing all day covered in other peoples' hair! I think life behind a computer in a strange way might give me more time outside doing the things I enjoy: walking the dog on the beach and gardening.

 If there was a â€˜Best Tan Lines in Tech Award' I would expect to be shortlisted :smile:
